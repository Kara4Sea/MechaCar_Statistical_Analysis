## Part 1 - Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero as r is measured at .7149. This is strong evidence of a positive linear relationship.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

This linear model does predict mpg ofof MechaCar prototypes effectively. The multiple R-squared is at 0.7149, which is considered strong. However, the P-value is under .05, which means data not normally distributed and similar results may not be found if tested again. It may be a good next step to complete simple linear regression models to fully understand the data.
